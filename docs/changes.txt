* changes v3.20 -> v3.30:

##
## Features
##

- Files: Use $HEX[...] in case the password includes the separater character, increases potfile reading performance
- Files: If the user specifies a folder to scan for wordlists instead of directly a wordlist, then ignore the hidden files
- Loopback: Include passwords for removed hashes present in the potfile to next loopback iteration

- Status screen: Reenabled automatic status screen display in case of stdin used
- Truecrypt/Veracrypt: Use CRC32 to verify headers instead of fuzzy logic, greatly reduces false positives from 18:2^48 to 3:2^64
- WPA cracking: Reuse PBKDF2 intermediate keys if duplicate essid is detected

##
## Algorithms
##

- Added hash-mode 1300 = SHA-224

##
## Bugs
##

The CLI (hashcat.bin or hashcat.exe) works as before but from a technical perspective it's a library frontend.

- If cracking a large salted hashlist the wordlist reject code was too slow to handle it, leading to 0H/s
- Null-pointer dereference in outfile-check shutdown code when using --outfile-check-dir, leading to segfault
- On startup hashcat tried to access the folder defined in INSTALL_FOLDER, leading to segfault if that folder was not existing
- Random rules generator code used invalid parameter for memory copy function (M), leading to use of invalid rule
- Sanity check for --outfile-format was broken if used in combination with --show or --left
