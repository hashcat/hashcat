* changes v3.20 -> v3.30:

##
## Features
##

- Files: Use $HEX[...] in case the password includes the separater character, increases potfile reading performance
- Files: If the user specifies a folder to scan for wordlists instead of directly a wordlist, then ignore the hidden files
- Loopback: Include passwords for removed hashes present in the potfile to next loopback iteration
- New option --progress-only: Quickly provides ideal progress step size and time to process on the user hashes and selected options, then quit
- Status screen: Reenabled automatic status screen display in case of stdin used
- Truecrypt/Veracrypt: Use CRC32 to verify headers instead of fuzzy logic, greatly reduces false positives from 18:2^48 to 3:2^64
- WPA cracking: Reuse PBKDF2 intermediate keys if duplicate essid is detected

##
## Algorithms
##

- Added hash-mode 1300 = SHA-224

##
## Bugs
##

- Fixed buffer overflow in status screen display in case of long non-utf8 string

- Fixed infinite loop when using --loopback in case all hashes have been cracked

* changes v3.10 -> v3.20:

The hashcat core was completely refactored to be a MT-safe library (libhashcat).
The goal was to help developers include hashcat into distributed clients or GUI frontends.
The CLI (hashcat.bin or hashcat.exe) works as before but from a technical perspective it's a library frontend.

##

- New option --opencl-info: Show details about OpenCL compatible devices like an embedded clinfo tool (useful for bug reports)
- Documents: Added colors for warnings (yellow) and errors (red) instead of WARNING: and ERROR: prefix

- If cracking a hash-mode using unicode passwords, length check of a mask was not taking into account
- If cracking a large salted hashlist the wordlist reject code was too slow to handle it, leading to 0H/s
- Null-pointer dereference in outfile-check shutdown code when using --outfile-check-dir, leading to segfault
- On startup hashcat tried to access the folder defined in INSTALL_FOLDER, leading to segfault if that folder was not existing
- Random rules generator code used invalid parameter for memory copy function (M), leading to use of invalid rule
- Sanity check for --outfile-format was broken if used in combination with --show or --left
