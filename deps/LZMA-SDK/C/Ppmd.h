   PPMD code always uses 32-bit internal fields in PPMD structures to store internal references in main block.
   if (PPMD_32BIT is     defined), the PPMD code stores internal pointers to 32-bit reference fields.
   if (PPMD_32BIT is NOT defined), the PPMD code stores internal UInt32 offsets to reference fields.
   if (pointer size is 64-bit), then (PPMD_32BIT) mode is not allowed,
   if (pointer size is 32-bit), then (PPMD_32BIT) mode is optional,
     and it's allowed to disable PPMD_32BIT mode even if pointer is 32-bit.
   PPMD code works slightly faster in (PPMD_32BIT) mode.

   PPMD code can write full CPpmd_State structure data to CPpmd*_Context
      at (byte offset = 2) instead of some fields of original CPpmd*_Context structure.
   
   If we use pointers to different types, but that point to shared
   memory space, we can have aliasing problem (strict aliasing).
   
   XLC compiler in -O2 mode can change the order of memory write instructions
   in relation to read instructions, if we have use pointers to different types.
   
   To solve that aliasing problem we use combined CPpmd*_Context structure
   with unions that contain the fields from both structures:
   the original CPpmd*_Context and CPpmd_State.
   So we can access the fields from both structures via one pointer,
   and the compiler doesn't change the order of write instructions
   in relation to read instructions.

   If we don't use memory write instructions to shared memory in
   some local code, and we use only reading instructions (read only),
   then probably it's safe to use pointers to different types for reading.
