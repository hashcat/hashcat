LZMA SDK 24.09
--------------

LZMA SDK provides the documentation, samples, header files,
libraries, and tools you need to develop applications that 
use 7z / LZMA / LZMA2 / XZ compression.

LZMA is an improved version of famous LZ77 compression algorithm. 
It was improved in way of maximum increasing of compression ratio,
keeping high decompression speed and low memory requirements for 
decompressing.

LZMA2 is a LZMA based compression method. LZMA2 provides better 
multithreading support for compression than LZMA and some other improvements.

7z is a file format for data compression and file archiving.
7z is a main file format for 7-Zip compression program (www.7-zip.org).
7z format supports different compression methods: LZMA, LZMA2 and others.
7z also supports AES-256 based encryption.

XZ is a file format for data compression that uses LZMA2 compression.
XZ format provides additional features: SHA/CRC check, filters for 
improved compression ratio, splitting to blocks and streams,

UNIX/Linux version 
------------------
There are several otpions to compile 7-Zip with different compilers: gcc and clang.
Also 7-Zip code contains two versions for some critical parts of code: in C and in Assembeler.
So if you compile the version with Assembeler code, you will get faster 7-Zip binary.

7-Zip's assembler code uses the following syntax for different platforms:

1) x86 and x86-64 (AMD64): MASM syntax. 
   There are 2 programs that supports MASM syntax in Linux.
'    'Asmc Macro Assembler and JWasm. But JWasm now doesn't support some 
      cpu instructions used in 7-Zip.
   So you must install Asmc Macro Assembler in Linux, if you want to compile fastest version
   of 7-Zip  x86 and x86-64:
     https://github.com/nidud/asmc

2) arm64: GNU assembler for ARM64 with preprocessor. 
   That systax of that arm64 assembler code in 7-Zip is supported by GCC and CLANG for ARM64.

There are different binaries that can be compiled from 7-Zip source.
There are 2 main files in folder for compiling:
  makefile        - that can be used for compiling Windows version of 7-Zip with nmake command
  makefile.gcc    - that can be used for compiling Linux/macOS versions of 7-Zip with make command

At first you must change the current folder to folder that contains `makefile.gcc`:

  cd CPP/7zip/Bundles/Alone7z

Then you can compile `makefile.gcc` with the command:

  make -j -f makefile.gcc

Also there are additional "*.mak" files in folder "CPP/7zip/" that can be used to compile 
7-Zip binaries with optimized code and optimzing options.

To compile with GCC without assembler:
  cd CPP/7zip/Bundles/Alone7z
  make -j -f ../../cmpl_gcc.mak

To compile with CLANG without assembler:
  make -j -f ../../cmpl_clang.mak

To compile 7-Zip for x86-64 with asmc assembler:
  make -j -f ../../cmpl_gcc_x64.mak

To compile 7-Zip for arm64 with assembler:
  make -j -f ../../cmpl_gcc_arm64.mak

To compile 7-Zip for arm64 for macOS:
  make -j -f ../../cmpl_mac_arm64.mak

Also you can change some compiler options in the mak files:
  cmpl_gcc.mak
  var_gcc.mak
  warn_gcc.mak



Also you can use p7zip (port of 7-Zip for POSIX systems like Unix or Linux):

LZMA features
-------------
  - Variable dictionary size (up to 4 GB)
  - Estimated compressing speed: about 2 MB/s on 2 GHz CPU
  - Estimated decompressing speed: 
      - 20-30 MB/s on modern 2 GHz cpu
      - 1-2 MB/s on 200 MHz simple RISC cpu: (ARM, MIPS, PowerPC)
  - Small memory requirements for decompressing (16 KB + DictionarySize)
  - Small code size for decompressing: 5-8 KB

LZMA decoder uses only integer operations and can be 
implemented in any modern 32-bit CPU (or on 16-bit CPU with some conditions).

Some critical operations that affect the speed of LZMA decompression:
  1) 32*16 bit integer multiply
  2) Mispredicted branches (penalty mostly depends from pipeline length)
  3) 32-bit shift and arithmetic operations

The speed of LZMA decompressing mostly depends from CPU speed.
Memory speed has no big meaning. But if your CPU has small data cache, 
overall weight of memory speed will slightly increase.


How To Use
----------

Using LZMA encoder/decoder executable
--------------------------------------

Usage:  LZMA <e|d> inputFile outputFile [<switches>...]

  e: encode file

  d: decode file

  b: Benchmark. There are two tests: compressing and decompressing 
     with LZMA method. Benchmark shows rating in MIPS (million 
     instructions per second). Rating value is calculated from 
     measured speed and it is normalized with Intel's Core 2 results.
     Also Benchmark checks possible hardware errors (RAM 
     errors in most cases). Benchmark uses these settings:
     (-a1, -d21, -fb32, -mfbt4). You can change only -d parameter. 
     Also you can change the number of iterations. Example for 30 iterations:
       LZMA b 30
     Default number of iterations is 10.

<Switches>
  

  -a{N}:  set compression mode 0 = fast, 1 = normal
          default: 1 (normal)

  d{N}:   Sets Dictionary size - [0, 31], default: N=24 (32 MB)
          The maximum value for dictionary size is N=31 (2 GB).
          Dictionary size is calculated as DictionarySize = 2^N bytes. 
          For decompressing file compressed by LZMA method with dictionary 
          size D = 2^N you need about D bytes of memory (RAM).

  -fb{N}: set number of fast bytes - [5, 273], default: 128
          Usually big number gives a little bit better compression ratio 
          and slower compression process.

  -lc{N}: set number of literal context bits - [0, 8], default: 3
          Sometimes lc=4 gives gain for big files.

  -lp{N}: set number of literal pos bits - [0, 4], default: 0
          lp switch is intended for periodical data when period is 
          equal 2^N. For example, for 32-bit (4 bytes) 
          periodical data you can use lp=2. Often it's better to set lc0, 
          if you change lp switch.

  -pb{N}: set number of pos bits - [0, 4], default: 2
          pb switch is intended for periodical data 
          when period is equal 2^N.

  -mf{MF_ID}: set Match Finder. Default: bt4. 
              Algorithms from hc* group doesn't provide good compression 
              ratio, but they often works pretty fast in combination with 
              fast mode (-a0).

              Memory requirements depend from dictionary size 
              (parameter "d" in table below). 

               MF_ID     Memory                   Description

                bt2    d *  9.5 + 4MB  Binary Tree with 2 bytes hashing.
                bt3    d * 11.5 + 4MB  Binary Tree with 3 bytes hashing.
                bt4    d * 11.5 + 4MB  Binary Tree with 4 bytes hashing.
                bt5    d * 11.5 + 4MB  Binary Tree with 5 bytes hashing.
                hc4    d *  7.5 + 4MB  Hash Chain with 4 bytes hashing.
                hc5    d *  7.5 + 4MB  Hash Chain with 5 bytes hashing.

  -eos:   write End Of Stream marker. By default LZMA doesn't write 
          eos marker, since LZMA decoder knows uncompressed size 
          stored in .lzma file header.

  -si:    Read data from stdin (it will write End Of Stream marker).
  -so:    Write data to stdout


Examples:

1) LZMA e file.bin file.lzma -d16 -lc0 

compresses file.bin to file.lzma with 64 KB dictionary (2^16=64K)  
and 0 literal context bits. -lc0 allows to reduce memory requirements 
for decompression.


2) LZMA e file.bin file.lzma -lc0 -lp2

compresses file.bin to file.lzma with settings suitable 
for 32-bit periodical data (for example, ARM or MIPS code).

3) LZMA d file.lzma file.bin

decompresses file.lzma to file.bin.


Compression ratio hints
-----------------------

Recommendations
---------------

To increase the compression ratio for LZMA compressing it's desirable 
to have aligned data (if it's possible) and also it's desirable to locate
data in such order, where code is grouped in one place and data is 
grouped in other place (it's better than such mixing: code, data, code,
data, ...).


Filters
-------
You can increase the compression ratio for some data types, using
special filters before compressing. For example, it's possible to 
increase the compression ratio on 5-10% for code for those CPU ISAs: 
x86, IA-64, ARM, ARM-Thumb, PowerPC, SPARC.

You can find C source code of such filters in C/Bra*.* files

You can check the compression ratio gain of these filters with such 
7-Zip commands (example for ARM code):
No filter:
  7z a a1.7z a.bin -m0=lzma

With filter for little-endian ARM code:
  7z a a2.7z a.bin -m0=arm -m1=lzma        

It works in such manner:
Compressing    = Filter_encoding + LZMA_encoding
Decompressing  = LZMA_decoding + Filter_decoding

Compressing and decompressing speed of such filters is very high,
so it will not increase decompressing time too much.
Moreover, it reduces decompression time for LZMA_decoding, 
since compression ratio with filtering is higher.

These filters convert CALL (calling procedure) instructions 
from relative offsets to absolute addresses, so such data becomes more 
compressible.

For some ISAs (for example, for MIPS) it's impossible to get gain from such filter.
