HISTORY of the LZMA SDK
-----------------------

24.09          2024-11-29
-------------------------
- The default dictionary size values for LZMA/LZMA2 compression methods were increased:
         dictionary size   compression level
  v24.08  v24.09  v24.09   
          32-bit  64-bit    
    8 MB   16 MB   16 MB   -mx4
   16 MB   32 MB   32 MB   -mx5 : Normal
   32 MB   64 MB   64 MB   -mx6
   32 MB   64 MB  128 MB   -mx7 : Maximum
   64 MB   64 MB  256 MB   -mx8
   64 MB   64 MB  256 MB   -mx9 : Ultra
  The default dictionary size values for 32-bit versions of LZMA/LZMA2 don't exceed 64 MB.
- If an archive update operation uses a temporary archive folder and 
  the archive is moved to the destination folder, 7-Zip shows the progress of moving 
  the archive file, as this operation can take a long time if the archive is large.
- Some bugs were fixed.


24.07          2024-06-19
-------------------------
- Changes in files:
    Asm/x86/Sha256Opt.asm
  Now it uses "READONLY" flag for constant array segment.
  It fixes an issue where ".rodata" section in 7-Zip for x86/x64 Linux had a "WRITE" attribute.


24.05          2024-05-14
-------------------------
- New switch -myv={MMNN} to set decoder compatibility version for 7z archive creating.
  {MMNN} is 4-digit number that represents the version of 7-Zip without a dot.
  If -myv={MMNN} switch is specified, 7-Zip will only use compression methods that can 
  be decoded by the specified version {MMNN} of 7-Zip and newer versions.
  If -myv={MMNN} switch is not specified, -myv=2300 is used, and 7-Zip will only
  use compression methods that can be decoded by 7-Zip 23.00 and newer versions.
- New switch -myfa={FilterID} to    allow 7-Zip to use the specified filter method for 7z archive creating.
- New switch -myfd={FilterID} to disallow 7-Zip to use the specified filter method for 7z archive creating.


24.03          2024-03-23
-------------------------
- 7-Zip now can use new RISCV filter for compression to 7z and xz archives.
  RISCV filter can increase compression ratio for data containing executable
  files compiled for RISC-V architecture.
- The speed for LZMA and LZMA2 decompression in ARM64 version for Windows
  was increased by 20%-60%.
  It uses arm64 assembler code, and clang-cl is required for arm64 assembler code compiling.
- -slmu switch : to show timestamps as UTC instead of LOCAL TIME.
- -slsl switch : in console 7-Zip for Windows : to show file paths with 
  linux path separator slash '/' instead of backslash separator '\'.
- 7-Zip supports .sha256 files that use backslash path separator '\'.
- Some bugs were fixed.


24.01          2024-01-31
-------------------------
- 7-Zip uses file C/Precomp.h that is included to all c and c++ files.
  CPP/Common/Common.h also includes C/Precomp.h.
  C/Precomp.h defines the following macros (if _WIN32 is defined):
    Z7_LARGE_PAGES 1
    Z7_LONG_PATH 1
    Z7_WIN32_WINNT_MIN  0x0500 (or higher)
    _WIN32_WINNT        0x0500 (or higher)
    WINVER  _WIN32_WINNT
    UNICODE 1
    _UNICODE 1
  if _WIN32_WINNT is defined already, C/Precomp.h doesn't redefine it.

- Speed optimizations for hash caclulation: CRC-32, CRC-64.
- The bug was fixed: 7-Zip for Linux could fail for multivolume creation in some cases.
- 7zr.exe for arm64 is included to LZMA SDK package.
- Some bugs were fixed.


23.01          2023-06-20
-------------------------
- 7-Zip now can use new ARM64 filter for compression to 7z and xz archives.
  ARM64 filter can increase compression ratio for data containing executable 
  files compiled for ARM64 (AArch64) architecture.
  Also 7-Zip now parses executable files (that have exe and dll filename extensions) 
  before compressing, and it selects appropriate filter for each parsed file: 
    - BCJ or BCJ2 filter for x86 executable files,
    - ARM64 filter for ARM64 executable files.
  Previous versions by default used x86 filter BCJ or BCJ2 for all exe/dll files.
- Default section size for BCJ2 filter was changed from 64 MiB to 240 MiB.
  It can increase compression ratio for executable files larger than 64 MiB.
- Some optimizations in filters code: BCJ, BCJ2, Swap* and opthers.
- If 7-Zip uses BCJ2 filter for big datasets compressing, it can use additional temp 
  files in system's TEMP folder. 7-Zip uses temp file for additional compressed 
  data stream, if size of such compressed stream is larger than predefined limit: 
  16 MiB in 32-bit version, 4 GiB in 64-bit version.
- When new 7-Zip creates multivolume archive, 7-Zip keeps in open state
  only volumes that still can be changed. Previous versions kept all volumes 
  in open state until the end of the archive creation.
- 7-Zip for Linux and macOS now can reduce the number of simultaneously open files,
  when 7-Zip opens, extracts or creates multivolume archive. It allows to avoid 
  the failures for cases with big number of volumes, bacause there is a limitation 
  for number of open files allowed for a single program in Linux and macOS.
- Some bugs were fixed.
- Source code changes:
- All external macros for compiling C/C++ code of 7-Zip now have Z7_ prefix.
- 7-Zip COM interfaces now use new macros that allow to declare and implement COM interface.
- The code has been modified to compile with the maximum diagnostic warning level:
    -Wall in MSVC and -Weverything in CLANG.
  And some warning types are disabled in 2 files:
    - C/Compiler.h for C/C++ code warnings.
    - CPP/Common/Common.h for C++ code warnings.
- Linux/macOS versions of 7-Zip: IUnknown interface in new code doesn't use 
  virtual destructor that was used in previous 7-Zip and p7zip:
     // virtual ~IUnknown() {}
  So 7-Zip's dynamically linked shared libraries (codecs) are not compatible 
  between new 7-Zip for Linux/macOS and old 7-Zip (and p7zip).


21.07          2021-12-26
-------------------------
- New switches: -spm and -im!{file_path} to exclude directories from processing 
    for specified paths that don't contain path separator character at the end of path.
- The sorting order of files in archives was slightly changed to be more consistent
  for cases where the name of some directory is the same as the prefix part of the name
  of another directory or file.


21.06          2021-11-24
-------------------------
- Bug in LZMA encoder in file LzmaEnc.c was fixed:
  LzmaEnc_MemEncode(), LzmaEncode() and LzmaCompress() could work incorrectly, 
    if size value for output buffer is smaller than size required for all compressed data.
  LzmaEnc_Encode() could work incorrectly,
    if callback ISeqOutStream::Write() doesn't write all compressed data.
  NCompress::NLzma::CEncoder::Code() could work incorrectly,
    if callback ISequentialOutStream::Write() returns error code.
- Bug in versions 21.00-21.05 was fixed:
  7-Zip didn't set attributes of directories during archive extracting.


21.04 beta     2021-11-02
-------------------------
- 7-Zip now reduces the number of working CPU threads for compression,
  if RAM size is not enough for compression with big LZMA2 dictionary.
- 7-Zip now can create and check "file.sha256" text files that contain the list 
  of file names and SHA-256 checksums in format compatible with sha256sum program.


21.03 beta     2021-07-20
-------------------------

20.02 alpha    2020-08-08
-------------------------
- The default number of LZMA2 chunks per solid block in 7z archive was increased to 64.
  It allows to increase the compression speed for big 7z archives, if there is a big number 
  of CPU cores and threads.
- The speed of PPMd compressing/decompressing was increased for 7z archives.
- The new -ssp switch. If the switch -ssp is specified, 7-Zip doesn't allow the system 
  to modify "Last Access Time" property of source files for archiving and hashing operations. 
- Some bugs were fixed.


20.00 alpha    2020-02-06
-------------------------
- 7-Zip now supports new optional match finders for LZMA/LZMA2 compression: bt5 and hc5, 
  that can work faster than bt4 and hc4 match finders for the data with big redundancy.
- The compression ratio was improved for Fast and Fastest compression levels with the 
  following default settings:
   - Fastest level (-mx1) : hc5 match finder with 256 KB dictionary.
   - Fast    level (-mx3) : hc5 match finder with 4 MB dictionary.
- Minor speed optimizations in multithreaded LZMA/LZMA2 compression for Normal/Maximum/Ultra 
  compression levels.

  There was memory leak in multithreading xz decoder - XzDecMt_Decode(),
  if xz stream contains only one block.
- The changes for MSVS compiler makefiles: 
   - the makefiles now use "PLATFORM" macroname with values (x64, x86, arm64)
     instead of "CPU" macroname with values (AMD64, ARM64).
   - the makefiles by default now use static version of the run-time library.


18.05          2018-04-30
-------------------------
- The speed for LZMA/LZMA2 compressing was increased 
    by 8% for fastest/fast compression levels and 
    by 3% for normal/maximum compression levels.
- Previous versions of 7-Zip could work incorrectly in "Large memory pages" mode in
  Windows 10 because of some BUG with "Large Pages" in Windows 10. 
  Now 7-Zip doesn't use "Large Pages" on Windows 10 up to revision 1709 (16299).
- The BUG was fixed in Lzma2Enc.c
    Lzma2Enc_Encode2() function worked incorretly,
      if (inStream == NULL) and the number of block threads is more than 1.


18.03 beta     2018-03-04

  the following code worked incorrectly:
  -  LZMA : LzmaEnc_MemEncode(), LzmaEncode() : LZMA encoding functions 
     for compressing from memory to memory. 
     That BUG is not related to LZMA encoder version that works via streams.
  -  LZMA2 : multi-threaded version of LZMA2 encoder worked incorrectly, if 
     default value of chunk size (CLzma2EncProps::blockSize) is changed 
     to value larger than (4 GiB - dictionary_size).

  The fixed 7-Zip creates temporary archive in folder that contains updated archive.
- The BUG in 9.33-9.35 was fixed:
  7-Zip silently ignored file reading errors during 7z or gz archive creation,
  and the created archive contained only part of file that was read before error.
